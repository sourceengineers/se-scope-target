The following repository contains the definition of the protobuf types used by the se-scope. 
For the embedded part, the .proto ist compiled to NanoPB sources.

The option file is used to restrict sizes of certain arrays and strings before compile time.
This option only affects the files generated by the NanoPB plugin.
It should be possible to build the sources during the cmake generation. This is not currently implemented.
# Build for NanoPB
Build NanoPB with:
```bash
protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-nanopb=../../3rdparty/nanopb/generator/protoc-gen-nanopb --nanopb_out=. ./se-scope.proto
```

# Build for typescript 
Add: npm install ts-protoc-gen@next
and then run:
```bash
protoc \
    --plugin="protoc-gen-ts=../../node_modules/.bin/protoc-gen-ts" \
    --js_out="import_style=commonjs,binary:../../src/shared/" \
    --ts_out=../../src/shared/ se-scope.proto 
```

# Build for python
The test vectors for protobuf are generated with python. To build the python definitions run: 
```bash
protoc -I=. --python_out=../../test/Serialisation/Protobuf/ ./se-scope.proto
```
