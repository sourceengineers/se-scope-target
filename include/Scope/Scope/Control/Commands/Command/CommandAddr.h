 * @brief        Implementation of the cf_addr command
 *                
 *               To configure the command, the CommandAddrConf Object has to be 
 *               passed to the setCommandAttribute function.
 *                
 *               The field numberOfChangedChannels is indicating how many
 *               many channels will be changed. The field changedChannels 
 *               contains the channels which will be changed. The field 
 *               newAddresses contains the new addresses and types the machting 
 *               types of addresses to which will be fed into the channels.
 *
 *               All of these fields cannot be longer than 
 *               numberOfChangedChannels or it will be ingored.
 *
